# Codesignal - Intro

Solutions to Codesignal's 'Intro' track. This section of the repository contains solutions to Codesignal's Intro problems.
Each of the solutions contain a makefile, a driver program, and an input file with inputs taken from the default unlocked test cases.
Directions on how to run each program are in the readme.md files included in each problem directory.

## Compilation

Unless otherwise specified, each program is compiled with g++ with the following flags:

```~$ g++ -Wall -g -pedantic -pedantic-errors -std=c++11 -o <problemname> <problemname>.cpp```

and all programs have been compiled without the compiler complaining, and ran with the corresponding input file.
