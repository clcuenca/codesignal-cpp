# Codesignal - C++

This repository contains solutions to Codesignal's various problems.
Each solution contains a driver program and an input file with inputs taken from the default unlocked test cases.
Each solution is ran on the command line.

## Compilation

Unless otherwise specified, each program is compiled using g++ with the following flags:

```~$ g++ -Wall -g -pedantic -pedantic-errors -std=c++11 -o <problemname> <problemname>.cpp```

If make is installed on your system, type in ```~$ make``` in the problem's corresponding directory.
All programs have been compiled without compiler complaint and ran with the corresponding input file.

To run a program with the input file:
```~$ ./<program> < input.txt```
